# Custom Discord Game
A python script that allows you to show yourself playing a custom game on discord.

Steps for Installing:

Install Python
    Go to cmd and type pip install pypresence
    Go to discord applications and create one

Create and Configure the Application:

    Ensure you have created a Discord application as previously described.
    Obtain the Client ID and configure art assets.

Rich Presence Assets:

    Add any images you want to use in the "Rich Presence" > "Art Assets" section of your application. Note their names for use in the script.

Now just customize the script and image to your liking. I use catbox.moe
for the images but you use whatever you want :)
